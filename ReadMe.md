## Business Understanding

Ensuring access to clean and reliable water sources is critical for public health, economic development, and communities' overall well-being. However, in Tanzania, access to clean and reliable water remains a major socio-economic challenge. According to a World Bank report on universal access to water and sanitation in 2023, 39% (24 million) of the population in the country suffers from acute water shortage throughout the year. This leads to water-related preventable deaths and diseases, costing the Tanzanian economy more than $2.4 billion each year in excess medical costs and lost productivity. These are resources that could have been channeled towards much-needed development. It is estimated that providing adequate water through optimizing the current water supply will significantly reduce economic losses and generate savings that would facilitate more spending towards development.

### Business Problem

Tanzania's water supply system is characterized by frequent water pump breakdowns resulting from lack of proper maintenance and inefficient management. This leads to disruptions in water supply, exacerbating the acute shortage of clean water and subsequent socio-economic losses.

The government of Tanzania, in collaboration with NGOs and partner organizations, aims to enhance access to clean water by improving the maintenance and functionality of water wells across the country. To achieve this, water point sustainability risk levels across the supply system need to be projected by learning from current point profiles to guide stakeholders' decisions through highlighting:

- Most dilapidated wells that should be prioritized for maintenance, repairs, or rehabilitation.
- Sites to be earmarked for future wells.
- Data-driven recommendations that are responsive to stakeholders' needs and actionable guide improve management practices and water accessibility.

### Stakeholders

- Government of Tanzania: Interested in optimizing resources for maintaining and repairing water wells to ensure clean water access for citizens.
- NGOs focusing on clean water access: Seeking to identify and prioritize wells in need of repair to efficiently allocate resources and interventions.
- Private sector partners: Potentially interested in investing in water infrastructure projects aligned with corporate social responsibility initiatives or in collaboration with NGOs and governmental organizations.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to predict the operational/functionality status of water pumps based on various features related to the pumps' installation. Specifically, the project will:

- Evaluate factors that affect the functionality of a pump.
- Identify and model combinations of features that best predict the functionality of a water pump.
- Test and validate the accuracy of the model.
- Draw conclusions and recommendations.

For categorical columns, we'll encode them using one-hot encoding to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
In the provided code we'll use OneHotEncoder from scikit-learn to encode categorical columns into binary vectors.This will create binary columns for each category within each categorical feature.


#### Mapping Boolean Values to Numeric


This code snippet aims to replace boolean values (`True` and `False`) with numeric equivalents (`1` and `0`, respectively) for the 'permit' column in the training dataset. Here's the explanation:

Mapping boolean values to numeric representations is often useful for tasks such as machine learning, where algorithms may require numerical inputs rather than boolean ones.

    

#### Dropping 'id' Column from Training Set Labels

Dropping the 'id' column is a common preprocessing step, especially since the column doesn't contribute meaningful information to the analysis or model training process. In many datasets, 'id' columns are simply unique identifiers assigned to each data entry and are not relevant to the analysis tasks at hand. Removing such columns can simplify the dataset and improve computational efficiency.


#### Modelling: Train-Test Split

 The purpose of this step is to prepare the data for model training and evaluation.

Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets is essential for evaluating the performance of machine learning models. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to assess its performance on unseen data. This step helps to prevent overfitting and provides a more accurate estimation of the model's generalization ability.



#### Data Preprocessing: Handling Missing Values and Feature Scaling

This code snippet illustrates two essential preprocessing steps: handling missing values and scaling features. These steps are crucial for preparing the dataset before training machine learning models.

**Handling Missing Values with SimpleImputer**:
   - The `SimpleImputer` from the `sklearn.impute` module is used to handle missing values in the dataset.
   - In this example, missing values are replaced with the mean of the respective columns.
   
**Feature Scaling with StandardScaler**:
   - Feature scaling ensures that all features have the same scale, preventing certain features from dominating others during model training.
   
**Encoding Target Variable with LabelEncoder**:
   - For classification tasks with categorical target variables, the `LabelEncoder` from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module is used to encode class labels into numerical values.
  
These preprocessing steps are essential for improving the performance and interpretability of machine learning models. Handling missing values ensures that all data points are utilized in model training, while feature scaling helps in achieving better convergence and performance, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes. Encoding the target variable enables the use of classification algorithms that require numerical labels.
    

#### Shape of Feature Matrix and Target Variable

This code snippet prints the shapes of the feature matrix `X` and the target variable `y`. Understanding the shape of these arrays is essential for ensuring the compatibility of data with machine learning models.

- **Shape of X**: 
  - Indicates the dimensions of the feature matrix `X`.
  - The shape is represented as `(number of samples, number of features)`.

- **Shape of y**:
  - Indicates the dimensions of the target variable `y`.
  - The shape is represented as `(number of samples,)`.

Checking the shape of `X` and `y` is crucial for verifying that the data is properly loaded and processed, and it ensures that the dimensions align correctly for model training and evaluation.



#### Splitting Data into Training and Validation Sets

In machine learning, splitting the dataset into training and validation sets is crucial for model development and evaluation. Here's why it's important:

**Model Training**:
  - The training set is used to train the machine learning model by fitting it to the training data. This involves learning the underlying patterns and relationships between features and target labels.

**Model Evaluation**:
  - The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. By assessing the model's performance on unseen data (validation set), we can estimate how well the model generalizes to new, unseen examples.

**Preventing Overfitting**:
  - Splitting the data helps in detecting and preventing overfitting, where the model learns to memorize the training data rather than capturing underlying patterns. By evaluating the model on a separate validation set, we can detect overfitting and fine-tune model hyperparameters to improve generalization.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - The validation set is also used for hyperparameter tuning, such as optimizing regularization parameters or adjusting the model complexity. This process helps improve the model's performance and generalization ability.

**Assessing Performance**:
  - Splitting the data allows us to assess the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score, on the validation set. These metrics provide insights into how well the model performs on different aspects of classification or regression tasks.

By splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, we ensure that the machine learning model is trained effectively, evaluated accurately, and optimized for better performance and generalization on unseen data.

## Second Model: Logistics Regression with SMOTE

#### Adressing Imbalanced datasets

**SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**:
    - Class imbalance occurs when one class has significantly fewer instances than another class, which can lead to biased models.
  - SMOTE works by generating synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the class distribution in the dataset.

**Resampling Training Data**:
  - This resampling technique helps alleviate the class imbalance issue by increasing the representation of the minority class in the training data.

**Training Logistic Regression Model**:
  - By training on the resampled data, the model learns from a more balanced dataset, which can improve its ability to generalize to unseen data and make accurate predictions.

#### Why this is Important:

**Addressing Class Imbalance**:
  - Class imbalance is a common problem in machine learning, especially in scenarios where one class is rare compared to others.
  - By using SMOTE to oversample the minority class, we ensure that the model is exposed to sufficient examples of the minority class during training, improving its ability to recognize and classify such instances accurately.
**Enhancing Model Performance**:
  - Resampling techniques like SMOTE can lead to better model performance, especially in situations where class imbalance negatively impacts the model's ability to learn from the data.
  - Training the logistic regression model on the resampled data allows it to capture the underlying patterns more effectively, leading to more reliable predictions on unseen data.


#### Model performance

- **Confusion Matrix Visualization**:
  - The confusion matrix provides insight into the performance of the model by showing the count of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions for each class.
  
- **Assessing Model Performance**:
  - The confusion matrix visualization allows us to evaluate how well the logistic regression model performs on the validation data after being trained on resampled data.
  - It provides valuable information about the model's ability to correctly classify instances belonging to different classes and identify any potential misclassifications.

## Fourth Model: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


### Initializing, training, and evaluating K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification model

 **Evaluate the Model**: 
   - A classification report is generated using `classification_report(y_val, y_pred_knn)`.
   - The classification report provides metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class, offering insights into the model's performance.

This process helps assess the effectiveness of the KNN model in classifying the data.

**Confusion Matrix**:
The confusion matrix heatmap visualizes the performance of the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model in classifying the data. Each cell in the heatmap represents the count of data points that fall into a specific combination of true and predicted labels.

**True Label (Rows)**: The rows of the heatmap represent the true labels of the data points.
**Predicted Label (Columns)**: The columns represent the predicted labels by the KNN model.
**Diagonal Cells**: These cells represent the instances where the true label matches the predicted label. Higher values along the diagonal indicate accurate predictions.
**Off-diagonal Cells**: These cells represent instances of misclassification. The values in these cells indicate how many data points were incorrectly classified.
**Color Gradient**: The color intensity of the cells indicates the count of data points. Darker shades typically represent higher counts.

By examining the confusion matrix heatmap, we can assess the KNN model's performance across different classes. We can identify which classes are more accurately predicted and which ones have higher misclassification rates. This information helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the model and can guide further improvements or adjustments to the model parameters.
